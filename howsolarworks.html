                <h1>Solar panels</h1>
                <p>
                    Simply put, a solar panel works by allowing photons, or particles of light, to knock electrons free 
                    from atoms, generating a flow of electricity. Solar panels actually comprise many, smaller units 
                    called photovoltaic cells. (Photovoltaic simply means they convert sunlight into electricity.) 
                    Many cells linked together make up a solar panel.
                    Each photovoltaic cell is basically a sandwich made up of two slices of semi-conducting material, 
                    usually silicon — the same stuff used in microelectronics.

                <p>
                    A charge controller or charge regulator is basically a voltage and/or current regulator to keep batteries 
                    from overcharging. It regulates the voltage and current coming from the solar panels going to the battery. 
                    Most but not all 12 volt panels put out about 16 to 20 volts, so if there is no regulation the batteries 
                    will be damaged from overcharging. Most batteries need around 14 to 14.5 volts to get fully charged.

                <p>
                    Battery storage systems generally consist of three main components. 
                    a battery which contains individual battery cells wired together, 
                    capable of discharging and being charged with DC voltage. 
                    inverter-charger unit which is capable of converting DC electricity from the battery to AC electricity 
                    and converting AC to DC for charging the battery from mains power. balance of system components such as 
                    wiring, battery management systems and other measurement and control components such as meters and switches.

                <h1>DC power</h1>
                <p>
                    Direct current or DC electricity is the continuous movement of electrons from an area of negative 
                    charges to an area of positive. A DC circuit is necessary to allow the current or steam of 
                    electrons to flow. Such a circuit consists of a source of electric energy (such as a battery) 
                    and a conducting wire running from the positive end of the source to the negative terminal. 
                    DC electricity in a circuit consists of voltage, current and resistance. 
                    The flow of DC electricity is similar to the flow of water through a hose.

                <p>
                    A inverter plays an essential role like a brain. The main function of this is to alter DC power to AC 
                    power which is generated from the solar array. Inverters convert direct current (DC) energy which is 
                    generated from the solar panels into usable alternating current (AC) energy. This current can be used 
                    for different applications like in a viable electrical grid otherwise off-grid electrical network. 
                    These inverters have some functions with PV arrays like tracking of utmost PowerPoint & protection of 
                    anti-islanding.

                <h1>AC power</h1>
                <p>
                    Alternating current describes the flow of charge that changes direction periodically. 
                    As a result, the voltage level also reverses along with the current. AC is used to deliver power to houses, 
                    office buildings, etc. AC can be produced using a device called an alternator. 
                    This device is a special type of electrical generator designed to produce alternating current. 
                    AC can come in a number of forms, as long as the voltage and current are alternating.
